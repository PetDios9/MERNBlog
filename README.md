This blog web app was created to show my ability to be able to create a MERN stack web application. The client side was created using React and Material UI as the CSS framework. It also uses the dependency Axios to send requests to the backend in a more minimal and easy to read way. The backend uses an API I created by utilizing Express to handle data requests from the MongoDB database Mongoose in order to simplify communication with MongoDB for creating blogs as well as handling the request types the web app will be sending. It was because of this project that I learned how to create an API and I will continuously update my project to also include authentication so that users may be created and only the users that created a blogs will be able to also delete it, at the moment anyone can do so.
